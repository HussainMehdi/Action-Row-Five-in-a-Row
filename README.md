; FIVE IN A ROW (Action Row) 
  
WITH CPU 3 LEVEL AI and Networking

THIS GAME IS CALLED "FIVE IN A ROW" BUT I NAMED IT AS "ACTION ROW"

This application is built with Netbeans 7.4; by opening this project in netbeans 7.4 you can easily compile.


Music will not work when you compile and run directly from Netbeans and for that reason you must have to compile jar file and keep it in a folder which have subdirectory name sounds and having default sound included in this package.


The network-play in this game is not configured on any specific IP-Address and it is configured for "localhost", so for testing networking open this game twice and first create server and then with another app click on join server. Server might take some time (about 1second) to update status on opponent’s grid but this can be neglected when both opponents will be playing in different room so they won’t know this delay.

Kindly refer to the Generated Documentation for more details.


The setup and executable file is also included in this package so that you may install or run this game without compiling it.
